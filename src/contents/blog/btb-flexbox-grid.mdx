## Introduction

Back to Basic will answer some of my questions when I first started learning CSS. Personally, I think when you start learning CSS, it will be very hard, because CSS has about 520 properties that we can use. Of course, we won't use it all, there are many properties that I still didn't know, but there are plenty of properties that we need to understand to be proficient in CSS. This blog will not cover CSS from the really basic ones, but I will try to show you the implementation.

> If you never have used flexbox or grid before, you can check this [flexbox guide](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) and [grid guide](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/) from css-tricks.
